## Differences with the original

The main difference between our game and the original are the cowboys: in the original once you hit one, it dissapears and when you make all of them dissapear, the saloon opens and a minigame starts. We don't have neither that minigame nor the disappearance of the cowboys. 

Besides, in the original game you gather the score of all the five games. In our game you loose all the punctuation every time you loose the game. The highest score of the five games is shown at the end.

## Controls

## Combos

Every time you touch with the ball ont of the three triangles of the ground in the upper side of the map, you increase your bonus. This bonus is a multiplier wich increases your score at the end of the game. The maximum you can get is a x10.

You also have a lot of extra score if you manage to enter in the canyon or into the wagon at the left side of the map.
