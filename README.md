## Differences with the original

The main difference between our game and the original are the cowboys: in the original once you hit one, it dissapears and when you make all of them dissapear, the saloon opens and a minigame starts. We don't have neither that minigame nor the disappearance of the cowboys. 

Besides, in the original game you gather the score of all the five games. In our game you loose all the punctuation every time you loose the game. The highest score of the five games is shown at the end.
